# Instability
This projectâ€™s goal was to build a Mars rover with the aim of mapping an undiscovered arena, identifying and locating the aliens, obstacles, and underground structures in its course. The rover must be able to avoid these obstacles and get back on track without getting derailed from its course. Live information regarding the position and status of the rover needs to be transmitted securely, while all data can be visualised on a website. This web-page also allows the users to manually send movement commands for the rover to complete. The project also involved a separate power station that the rover returns to when the battery requires charging.

This repo contains the codes for the Command WebApp for the Instability Rover.
